# Cleanux

Cleanux is a command-line utility for cleaning up and optimizing Ubuntu systems. It provides a set of cleanup steps to remove unnecessary packages, clear cache, remove old kernels, clean up APT cache, remove orphaned packages, clean up old configuration files, and remove unused packages and their associated configuration files. Cleanux helps improve disk space utilization and system performance by removing non-useful system files.

## Usage

To run Cleanux and perform the system cleanup, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.

2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Cleanux script.

3. Run the script to execute Cleanux.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm or skip each cleanup step.

5. Cleanux will display the amount of disk space saved after each successful cleanup step.

6. Once the cleanup process is complete, Cleanux will display a message indicating the completion of the cleanup.
